## The Problem

Lian is the dying ruler of a wealthy kingdom. He is renowned for being an avid lover of art and nature. Lian has no heirs to succeed him, so he issues a decree to all his subjects:

>_Whoever can bring me the most beautiful flower or tree in the kingdom will be my successor._

## Your Mission 

Using **recursion** and the Python `turtle` library, draw a tree or flower to present to the king! You may want to look up `turtle` documentation for this!
